# Cluster add-ons configuration.
clusterAddOns:
  # List of add-ons to be deployed. By default, no add-ons are deployed.
  addOnList: []
  # Add-on configuration object.
  # @required -- name, chartTargetRevision
  #
  # For each add-on, a new Argo CD Application resource will be created.
  # Description of the fields:
  # - `name`: name of the add-on; REQUIRED;
  # - `chartRepoURL`: URL of the Helm chart repository which will be the source of the chart; defaults to the 
  #                   Schr√∂dinger's Stack Helm repository that has the same name as the add-on name above (e.g. 
  #                   `argo-cd` will default to `https://github.com/schrodingers-stack/helm-add-on-name`);
  # - `chartTargetRevision`: target revision of the repository where the chart is located; REQUIRED;
  # - `chartPath`: path to the chart in the repository; defaults to the root of the repository;
  # - `valuesRepoURL`: URL of the values repository which will be the source of the values; if not provided, it will
  #                    default to the value provided on the global `commonValuesRepoURL` value;
  # - `valuesTargetRevision`: target revision of the repository where the values are located; defaults to `HEAD`;
  # - `defaultValuesFiles`: list of default values files that will be used by the chart, usually some of the multiple 
  #                         values files found in the chart's repository; the order of the files, is important, each 
  #                         file overriding the content of the previous ones; defaults to an empty list;
  # - `extraValues`: extra values in YAML exactly as expected by the destination chart; takes precedence over the values
  #                  files provided by `valuesRepoURL` and `defaultValuesFiles`; defaults to an empty object;
  # - `namespace`: namespace where the resources of the add-on will be deployed; if not provided, it will default to the
  #                name of the add-on;
  # - `autoSync`: whether the application should be automatically synced; defaults to the global `autoSync` value;
  # - `additionalLabels`: additional labels to be added to the Argo CD Application of the add-on;
  # - `annotations`: annotations to be added to the Argo CD Application of the add-on;
  #
  # Order in which the values are parsed (the previous is overridden by the next):
  #   1. `defaultValuesFiles` (order of the files is important)
  #   2. `valuesRepoURL` the files in the repository, one global for the platform, another specific for the cluster)
  #   3. `commonValues` (global attribute)
  #   4. `extraValues`
